Thank you for your interest on our research activities. From the recent academic history, you'll see what we're currently doing.

## Research topics of our interests

* Physics and simulations of Gyrokinetics and turbulence transport in nuclear fusion
* Virtual Tokamak development (Digital twin, VR) - Unreal game engine, Unity, Blender, etc...
* Automatic unstructured mesh generation and its utilization - [PUMI](https://github.com/SCOREC/core)([RPI SCOREC](https://scorec.rpi.edu/)), SimModSuite([Simmetrix](http://www.simmetrix.com/))
* High performance computing (Code parallelization and optimization)
* Machine learning (Data-driven & Physics-Informed)
